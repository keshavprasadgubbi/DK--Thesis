\section*{Acknowledgments}
\initial{H}e has not thanked God who has not thanked people.'' First, I would like to thank both my tutors Laurent Lombez and Daniel Ory for their insight and mentorship, and for creating a collaborative and congenial working atmosphere for me during all the process of my internship. I thank them also for their time in reviewing my report, I am very grateful for that. 
\\Special thanks also goes to Dac-Trung Nguyen, postdoc fellow and IRDEP and Jerome Michallon, Posdoc fellow at LPN, for your precious help in MATLAB and mathematical problems, you really did a great work for the successful completion of my modeling part.  
\\ I cannot forget to thank everyone at IRDEP especially those who were attending the Monday meetings, you are a brilliant group of scientists, I really enjoyed listening to everyone's ideas, comments and discussions. This made my stay at IRDEP very fruitful because apart from my own research topic, I got a chance to learn about what other people are doing, this widened my knowledge in the PV field. This six months period  has really been a time of tremendous learning and growth for me both scientifically and personally. 
\\ Lastly I extend my thanks to TOTAL who provided me with a scholarship and took part in the REST masters program at Ecole polytechnique. I am really very grateful.
