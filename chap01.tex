 \section{Project Management}
 %\section*{IRDEP}
 \label{sec:sec001}
 A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique project, service, or result. (PMBOK, 2018).

According to ISO 21500, project consists of unique set of processes consisting of coordinated and controlled activities with start and end dates, performed to achieve project objectives. Achievement of the Project objectives requires the provision of deliverables conforming to specific requirements. A Project may be subjects to several constraints. Although many of the projects can be similar, or each project can be unique too. Project differences can occur due to the following reasons:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Provision of the deliverables,
     \item Stakeholders influences, 
     \item Usage of Resources,
     \item Constraints,
     \item Tailoring of processes to ensure deliverables.
 \end{itemize}
     

Every project has a predetermined beginning and end dates and mostly project is divided into several phases along with defined objectives and goals of the project.

Project management is the art of creating the illusion that any outcome is the result of a series of predetermined, deliberate acts when, in fact, it was damn luck. By Harold Kerzner

Project management is the application of the various methods, techniques, tools and competencies to a project. It is a discipline that gives principles, techniques and tools to accomplish project goals within time and budget constraints. Project management involves integration of various phases of the complete project life cycle. Project management consists of number of interlinking processes. A process is a sequence of actions who work towards same goals and objectives. These processes should be aligned in a systemic view. Each phase of the project life cycle have specific deliverables, these deliverables should be reviewed regularly during the project to meet all stakeholders requirements.

Project management comprises of planning, organizing, motivating and controlling all the resources to achieve intended goals. The first step of the project management is to ensure that the project delivers within the pre-defined limits and constraints. These constraints could range from time to budget and other situational risks. The subsequent step is to optimize the allocation of resources and to integrate the inputs required to achieve those pre-defined goals / requirements. To accomplish these goals, project manager has to control and monitor them. 

Project management enables the managers to run a project from beginning to the end phase in an efficient and effective manner keeping in mind all stakeholders interests.

According to the Project Management Institute, the term Project Stakeholder refer to, “an individual, group, or organization who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. ISO 21500 uses a similar definition. 


\textcolor{red}{A guide to the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK guide). Project Management Body of Knowledge (Fifth ed.). Newtown Square, PA: Project Management Institute. 6 September 2017. p. 589. ISBN 978-1-62825-390-0. OCLC 995162610.}

Stakeholders for the projects are individual or group entities whose interest lies within a given project. They can be both internal and external to an organization which either funds a project, have interest or gain upon success of the project or may have a positive or negative influence on project completion,

Owing to the dynamic and complex nature of business needs, managing resources and ensuring effective communications among team is a real challenge. Hence, Project management has become eminent for managing performance of business and industrial needs.
As every project is unique, even the approach defined to project management can be different. It depends on the type of business, sector and constraints defined by the clients.

Project management is a combination of art and science, as so many authors has stated that it is a mix of knowledge and skills , some acquired , others developed , some intrinsic characteristics traits of any individual or a group of persons , tools and techniques which constitutes of scientific , qualitative and quantitative which supports the decision-making process in project management.

Often, project management is defined by a triangle called “triple constraint”.
The three most important factors are time, cost and scope. These three factors form the vertices of the triangle with quality as the central theme. 


\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{fig01/Clean-Energy}
  \mycaption[Clean-energy]{The Triple Constraint}
 \end{figure}

The triple constraint has four elements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project must be completed within allocated cost,
    \item Project must be completed on time 
    \item Project deliverables must be in within scope
    \item Project must meet user quality requirements.
\end{enumerate}
In recent years the Project management triangle has given a way to the Project management diamond with cost, time, scope and quality as the four vertices and user expectations as the central theme. No two users have same requirements and expectations, it is important have a clear understanding of user generic and specific requirements.

\subsection{Project Management lifecycle}
\label{subsec:subsec01}
According to the PMBOK 2008 (Which edition), the PMBOK guide (the standard guidebook for project managers around the world) the project management lifecycle comprises of the five types of processes such as Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling and closing. These processes are elaborated as below: 
 
It is important to define the goals, objectives and critical success factors of the project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initiating:} In the initiation phase, there is a need to identify the project goals, after carefully investigating all the options to come up with the meaningful solution. Recognize and define the beginning of the project and the smooth continuity of one phase to another during the project. Initiation process keeps the team focused on the project goals. Initiating is the most critical stage in project management. It also halts the project if it fails to meet the customer expectations. It will create a domino effect, disrupting all the following stages as well the final outcomes.

    \item \textbf{Planning:} After clearly defining the scope of the project, the next phase is planning. It is the second most important phase of every project lifecycle because each project is unique and requires special approach. It is an ongoing process which continues through the entire project lifecycle. It answers all the questions as we create a feasible scheme which includes clearly defined activities, cost estimates, schedule development and resource planning.

    \item \textbf{Executing:} It is the part of the project management lifecycle where we physically construct the deliverables and present them to the user, who then decides upon it. It is usually the longest phase and also directly depends upon the duration of the project. The project manager controls activities, resources and costs while the team is performing the required activities. To carry out the process and ensuring accurate and complete information flow and team formulation.

    \item \textbf{Monitoring and Controlling:} Despite good planning and careful execution, projects fails if they lack control, mechanisms for the processes involved within the project. Monitoring the key performance indicators for the project and control the quality of the project results, observing the significant changes and making necessary adjustments as per requirements. To keep everything under control following checks are made, collecting data from spreadsheets and completed tasks, comparing it with the plan (like schedule and budget estimates). Another technique called Earned Value Management is used to measure performance of the project. It is a systemic process used to find variances in projects based on differences between task performed and tasks planned. It is used to control the schedule and the costs and can be useful for project forecasting too.

    \item \textbf{Closing:} Project closure allows the team to evaluate and document the complete information about the project. In the closing phase, we assess the project performance (in terms of objectives, scope, deliverables, schedule and cist), evaluate team member’s performance, list down project achievements and failures and keep data for future prospective projects. Formal acceptance of the project deliverables and dissolution of all the elements required to run the project. To gather all necessary data to validate the completed project. 

\end{enumerate}


Project life cycle is the series of the phases that the project which passes from its start to its completion. It also provides the basic framework for project management. The phases of the project lifecycle may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping.

Project lifecycles can be predictive or iterative, within a project lifecycle, there are generally one or more phases associated with the development of the results. These are called development life cycle, they can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid model.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Predictive life cycle also called Waterfall, the project scope, schedule and costs are determined in the early phases of the project.

    \item Iterative life cycle, project scope is generally determined in early phases of the project lifecycle, but schedule and cost are modified in a routine manner.

    \item Incremental lifecycle, deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add functionality within a predetermined time frame and is considered complete only after the final iteration takes place.

    \item Adaptive lifecycle are agile, iterative or incremental. The project scope is defined in a detail manner and agreed upon the start of an iteration. Adaptive lifecycles are also referred to as agile.
    \item Hybrid lifecycle, is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive lifecycle. 
  
\end{itemize}

The process does not necessarily follow the chronological pattern. As in due course of a project, sometimes things do get out of hands and are difficult to control. That is why processes usually overlaps throughout different phases of the project and ultimately become interdependent. All the phases of the project lifecycle interacts and are linked by their results. Subsequently the project manager sometimes has to return to earlier phases, makes necessary adjustments and amendments and keep continuing with the project management processes. 

 \begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{fig01/Clean-Energy}
  \mycaption[Clean-energy]{How processes overlap on a project}
 \end{figure}

For example, during the controlling and monitoring phase, if we need to allocate more resources to some activity, we need to modify the planning phase and amend resources planned for that activity. Else, inconsistency can have a major effect on entire project lifecycle.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{fig01/Clean-Energy}
  \mycaption[Clean-energy]{Flowchart}
 \end{figure}
 
 Processes are linked to each other by their outcomes, as output of one process becomes the input for another. For example, the planning process provides the execution process with a pre-determined project plan. But planning process plays an important role throughout as it updates the plan as the project makes progress into further processes. Project planning is the most significant process as it lays down the project plan with detail of all the work packages and predicts possible obstacles need to overcome along the project run.

It is not easy to achieve success with the project, if we rely completely on 
Clearly defined processes. Project management is both a science and an art.

\subsection{Role of a project manager}
\label{subsec:subsec02}

The role of the project manager involves planning and organizing the resources and schedule necessary for accomplishment of projects.

As per Project Management Institute, a project manager is organized, passionate and goal-oriented who understands what projects have in common, and their strategic role in how organizations succeed, learn and change.

They are change agents, they commit to the project goals, and use their skills and expertise to promote a sense of share purpose for the entire project team.
They work well under pressures and easily adapt with change and complexity in dynamic environments. They have good people skills and they possess abroad tools and techniques to resolve complex interdependent activities into tasks and sub-tasks that are documented, monitored and controlled.

In late 1980s, Microsoft encountered a problem of coordination amongst different teams. They came up with a solution to appoint an individual who has significant authority as a leader and a coordination for the project named Excel. They horizontally deployed project manager, processes ran more smoothly and team satisfaction with work dynamics. Later, Microsoft adopted Project Manager as a new role.

The Project manager has several key roles and responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activities and Resource Planning:}  Planning is instrumental for completion of a project. The prime task of a project manager is to define the project’s scope and determine the availability of resources. They create a clear and concise document for guiding throughout the project execution and project control.

\item \textbf{Organizing and motivating a project team:} They are in charge of developing a plan to support the team in order to achieve the project goals and control the performance.

\item \textbf{Time Management:} Users evaluate the performance of the project depending on whether it has been delivered on time and on-time completion of the project is the pre-requisite for the success of the project.

\item \textbf{Cost estimates and budget allocation:}  A project manager ensures the completion of the project within defined and allocated budget. They frequently review the budget plans and forecasts to avoid cost overruns.

\item \textbf{Ensure user satisfaction:} Users satisfaction is the most important key performance indicator to evaluate the project success. A project manager avoids uncertainty and keep user informed at every phase of the project.

\item \textbf{Analyzing and managing project risks:} A project manager identifies and evaluates the potential risks and develop appropriate strategies to avoid and minimize the risks and their impact on the project. 

\item \textbf{Monitor progress:} A project manager need to control and analyze the key performance indicators related to the cost and time; take appropriate preventive and corrective measures. 

\item \textbf{Creating and managing reports and necessary documentation:} Creating and managing reports and necessary documentation: Finally, an experienced project manager provides relevant documentation with final reports and also identifies areas of development for future projects.
\end{itemize}

Project managers are integral part of all organization ranging from big ones to small ones, who are in-charge of complex and ambitious projects.

 \section{Planning \& Scheduling in Project Management}
 %\section*{IRDEP}
 \label{sec:sec002}
 
 Planning and scheduling are two distinct but inseparable aspect of Project management. The process planning primarily medals with appropriate tools and techniques and methods to achieve the goals of the project. On the other hand, Scheduling deals with project baseline plan (Scope, cost and time) into an operational timetable. By merging together the project plan and the budget, schedule is the most important tool for project management. Further, integrated cost-time schedule serves as a fundamental basis for monitoring and controlling the project tasks thought out the project life cycle.

\section{General Project Planning Methodologies}
 %\section*{IRDEP}
 \label{sec:sec003}
 
 As project management began to be studied as a science and discovering various project archetypes, big corporations comes with different methodology and tools. As it spread over vast variety of industries, project managers tailored every approach and, methodology based on the industry requirements and different types of the projects.

For example, agile methodologies are effective on software development but it doesn’t work with infrastructure projects and vice-versa. Hence methods and techniques are bundled into methodologies to run a project consistently within time and within budget.

\emph{How to choose a right project management methodology?}
There are quite some good project planning methodologies available, so it can be difficult to choose the right one. \textbf{The focus of the thesis is primarily on project planning methodologies.}

A brief overview on different types of general project planning methodologies:

\subsection{Traditional Project Management Planning}

Traditional Project management is a universal practice which includes several techniques for planning, estimating and controlling activities. The aim of these techniques is to reach the desired project goals on time, within budget and in accordance to technical and managerial specifications. The ultimate goal is to make sure all the activities are carried out in a sequence.

In traditional planning, it is a sequence of steps taken to build the roadmap of the project and is one of the most fundamental step defining the performance of the project goals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To identify the project activities. 
    \item To estimate the project duration.
    \item To determine the required resources. 
    \item To develop a sequence of project activities network. 
    \item To develop a documented project plan.
\end{itemize}

Traditional project management planning is the most common way to plan projects. It is not a methodology rather it is a collection of techniques, like WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), dividing into phases. The different tools used in traditional planning are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item WBS - Work Breakdown Structure
    \item Project schedule and Plan - Gantt Chart 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ \textbf{Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):} }
 According to PMBOK, WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of work to be executed by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

The purpose of WBS is to define the project needs, to accomplish, and organize them into multiple levels, and displayed graphically in form of a chart.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{fig01/Clean-Energy}
  \mycaption[WBS]{WBS Image}
\end{figure}
 
The key terminologies used with WBS are work, deliverable and work packages. In the context to the project management, these terms have specific definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Work:} According to PMBOK, work refers to “work products or deliverables that are the result of effort and not the effort itself. The work defines the end result of the activity. The work remains constant even though the amount of effort needed is variable.
    \item \textbf{Deliverable:} PMBOK says that deliverable is “any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables vary with the project.
    \item \textbf{Work Package:} According to PERT, they developed WBS, a work package is “ the work required to complete a specific job or process, such as a report, design , a documentation requirement or portion thereof, a piece of hardware , or a service. "PMBOK“ provided a simpler definition; "a work package is the deliverable at the lowest level of the WBS.”
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ \textbf{Characteristics of a WBS:} }

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hierarchy:} The WBS is a hierarchical nature divided into macro activity and micro activities and former is the sum of all the latter activities.
100\%: Every level of decomposition should make up for 100\% of the macro activity.
    \item \textbf{Mutually exclusive:} All elements of the WBS must be mutually exclusive. There must be no overlap in the deliverables as it avoid duplication of activities.
    \item \textbf{Outcome-focused:}  The WBS focus on the deliverables not on the activities necessary to reach the goal.
\end{itemize}

Work Breakdown Structure data is the input to create a project schedule.

\textbf{Gantt chart:} Gantt chart is the most important technique in the traditional project management. It was created by Henry Gantt, which is who is considered as father of traditional project management.

It is an important tool for project planning, most useful ways of presenting tasks and activities of the project on a timeline. Currently, Gantt charts in excel. The Gantt chart is represented as -
 
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{fig01/Clean-Energy}
  \mycaption[Gantt]{Gantt Chart}
\end{figure}
 
 
By looking at the Gantt chart, it displays - 

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the project tasks are 
    \item Who is working on each task 
    \item How long each task could take 
    \item How tasks overlap and link with each other 
    \item The start and finish the date of the project
\end{itemize}

Gantt chart is used to track the projects schedules and make project management less cumbersome. It helps to understand the relationship between tasks in a clear manner, keep all the team members well informed and successfully complete the project.

In today's scenario due to COVID - 19, Even if we are using traditional tools like Gantt chart to manage the projects, as long as project team embraces changes, provides frequent and valuable output to the users, reflecting and adjusting as needed, it is compatible to agile methodology to manage projects. 

Traditional project planning tools in 21st century, as computer and internet became essentials parts of the business, processes became more complex and demanding, it no longer offers the best solutions for user's problems. The concept of traditional project planning tools has evolved and extended through different project management planning methodologies and frameworks.

Nevertheless, traditional management is still considered as foundation of all modern approaches and is still an inevitable methodology for big or complex infrastructure projects.

\subsection{Deterministic Methodology - Critical Path method (CPM)}

Critical Path Method (CPM) is the most important deterministic methodology for project planning and schedule. It is a mathematical algorithm, that helps, analyzes, plans and schedule complex projects.

Each project consists of tasks and activities that are interconnected and essential for project’s success. CPM comes into play when the project gets complex and demanding then traditional planning tools becomes ineffective.

At its core, CPM is a powerful tool that allows to identify the longest path of the planned activities critical to meet the deadlines and also identify the early start and finish dates.

By determining the critical path, we will know the activities are critical in completing the project, and which activities do not pose any serious impact on the project development.

How was CPM created? 

In late 50's, El Du Pont de Nemours, an American chemical company, were seriously behind schedule, and they needed help with it to come back on the timeframe to complete the project. They came up with a solution to divide their project into thousands of tasks, measure the time to complete each activity, to assess which activities are critical to the entire project. They called this technique Critical Path Method or CPM.It was first tested for as chemical plant construction project, and since then it is used as one of the most frequently used techniques of the project scheduling and planning. 

CPM is used to construct a model of the project that includes -
\begin{itemize}
	\item A list of the activities to complete the project using WBS
		\item The time (duration) of the each activity to achieve completion 
			\item The dependencies between the activities.
\end{itemize}




CPM calculates :
\begin{itemize}
	\item The longest path of the planned activities to the end of the project.
	\item The earliest and latest that each activity can begin and end without making the project longer.
\end{itemize}


Determine the critical activities “the longest path “
Prioritize the activities for the effective management and to shorten the planned critical of the project by 
Pruning the critical activities 
Fast tracking i.e performing more activities in parallel 
Crashing the critical path by shortening the durations of the critical path activities by adding resources.
