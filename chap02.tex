\chapter{Literature review}
\label{chap:litrev}
\initial{F}or the purpose of getting a clear idea of our research topic, this chapter is included to give a relatively brief description of the theoretical background in line with our research topic. Most of the information presented in this chapter can be found in any good solar cell or related physic textbook. We have tried to pick the most relevant parts and written in the most simplified way for a reader without a strong background on this topic. However the reader is advised to have a basic knowledge on the physics of semiconductors and(or) quantum mechanics.
